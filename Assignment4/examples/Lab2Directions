Copy the files from my home directory into yours

cp -r /home/derekj/lab2 {directory in your space}

Compile fib.c to use with gdb

Use gdb to determine how many times fib is called with n = 3 when the program is given 7
./a.out 7

For practice, quickly rewrite fib iteratively

Part 2:
Inside h/ rewrite h.c using the disassembled h.s
(Important parts start at .L2)
Then, fix the bug in h.c

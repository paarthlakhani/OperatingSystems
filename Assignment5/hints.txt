1. You have to use the wait queue using the header, linux/wait.h
chapter 6, look at page 149

load the module into the kernel:
sudo insmod hello.ko

Use this command to print the kernel log:
dmesg
dmesg | grep "hello"

Look at the list of currently loaded modules:
lsmod

remove your new module:
sudo rmmod hello

Make sure that the module is not present anymore and also make sure that 
"Unloading the hello kernel module." message appears in the log.

lsmod
dmesg

You may have noticed that in hello.c, we called printk() instead of printf(). To see 
the full list of functions that can be called from a kernel module:
cat /proc/kallsyms | grep ' T '

gcc -o userMode userMode.c
for simple testing you can use the command line to write into the file.

write text into in the command prompt:
echo awesomeness > test2.txt
echo "woohoo" > test2.txt

write a file in the command prompt:
cat test.txt > test2.txt

chapter3 --- minor -- tells me the file number

ssize_t write(struct file *filp, const char __user *buff, size_t count, loff_t *offp);
%zu for size_t data type
